# incur

A software package designed for analyzing IncuCyte-derived data, with a strong focus on generalisable and automated non-linear regression for interpretation of growth curves and dose-response relationships.

## Usage

The principle goal of incur is to provide a pipeline to export, segment, and analysis IncuCyte-derived data. 

However, the automated curve fitting functions are able to be used on any dataset, and includes option for shared parameters across groups, outlier detection, and upper/lower limits on parameters.
